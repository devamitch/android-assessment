# Wallet Watchlist take-home (Android)

**Time:** about 2-3 hours.

Checkout this branch, then work from the files in the repo.

## Product

A small treasury watchlist app:

- An admin maintains wallets on a watchlist, each with a remaining allowance and a status (`active` or `archived`)
- Anyone can deposit into the shared treasury balance
- Only a watchlisted wallet can withdraw, and only up to remaining allowance
- The screen lists wallets, can filter by status, and shows empty or error states clearly

## What to do

1. **Review** - Read `WatchlistStore.kt`, `WatchlistActivity.kt`, and `activity_watchlist.xml`. In `REVIEW.md`, list the problems you find (bugs, API/error handling, UI state, structure). Be concrete: file, behavior, why it matters.
2. **Fix** - Change the Kotlin (and XML if needed) to match the product rules below. Keep it small. You do not need Jetpack Compose, a backend, or a full Gradle rewrite.
3. **Design** - In `DESIGN.md`, write a short note (about half a page): how you would split UI, domain, and persistence if this stayed maintainable. Tradeoffs are enough. No extra features.

## Rules to honor in the fix

**Store**
- Wallet ids must be non-empty
- Amounts must be greater than 0
- Adding a wallet is admin-only
- Deposit credits the shared treasury balance
- Withdraw fails if the wallet is missing or the amount is above remaining allowance
- A successful withdraw lowers both the treasury balance and that wallet's remaining allowance
- Missing wallets should not look the same as a wallet with allowance `0`
- Failures should be explicit results/errors, not crashes or silent success

**UI**
- Status filter must actually filter the list
- Do not render wallet fields as raw HTML
- Show empty and error states
- Treasury balance on the screen must come from the treasury balance, not from an allowance lookup
- Handle failed withdraw/add/deposit instead of ignoring the response
- Do not store private keys or seed material in preferences
- Withdraw amount should be chosen by the user, not a hard-coded tap of `10`
